# ASNA
Alistair's SSH Network Automator

DISCLAIMER:
When testing the SFTP Download Directory function on a Linux server i did see 50% RAM increase after trying to download a huge directory structure
USE WITH CAUTION, and i advise test benches first, even after closing the service and PID the usage wouldn't drop


A simple tool dedicated to backing up SSH based machines with C#, useful for debugging or pulling out log files, which sucks and automating it all

Interested to see what everyone does with this, Always up to hear use cases or how i can make it better etc. Cheers
